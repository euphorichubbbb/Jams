# Motion Art Generation: Creating Dynamic Visual Experiences with Cinder

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Generate unique motion-based artwork using code and the Cinder framework

_Requirements:_ Computer with Cinder installed
_Language used:_ C++

_Customization opportunity:_ Experiment with different algorithms, parameters, and visuals to create a wide variety of motion-based artworks. Each participant can explore their own artistic vision and adjust the level of complexity according to their skills and interests.
_Platform Limitations:Windows, macOS, and Linux
_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour 

### Breakdown
- Set up: Installing Cinder on our computer and setting up a new Cinder project.
- Part 1: Understanding Cinder's architecture and workflow.
- Part 2:  Design and generate visual elements using code. Explore geometric shapes, patterns, colors, and textures.
- Part 3: Introduceing motion and animation to the visual elements. Experimenting with transformations, keyframe animations, and easing functions.
- Success!!! Now you've created your own dynamic motion art using Cinder!

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?

Participants will have the freedom to experiment and explore various algorithms, parameters, and visuals within the Cinder framework. They can choose different motion patterns, colors, shapes, and textures, allowing each participant to create a unique and personalized motion art piece based on their artistic vision.
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?

Motion art creation offers a unique blend of artistry and coding. Participants will have the opportunity to express their creativity through code, bringing dynamic visual experiences to life. The combination of aesthetics, interactivity, and the ability to create captivating animations makes motion art creation exciting and engaging for participants.
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam

Introduction: Provide an overview of motion art and its significance in the digital art world. Introduce the Cinder framework and its capabilities for creating motion-based artwork.
Hands-on coding exercises: Guide participants through practical exercises to familiarize them with Cinder's syntax, rendering pipeline, and animation techniques.
Creative exploration: Encourage participants to experiment and create their motion art pieces. Provide guidance and support as they develop their unique visual experiences.
Sharing: Allow participants to showcase and present their creations to the group, sharing insights and learnings from their creative process.
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)

Participants will gain a solid understanding of using Cinder for motion art creation, including knowledge of coding concepts, animation techniques, and rendering visuals. They will also have a final product—an original motion art piece—that they can showcase and share with others. 
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?

This workshop offers participants a unique blend of coding and artistic expression. They can explore their creativity by designing visually captivating animations and experimenting with various visual effects. The creative freedom to transform their ideas into dynamic motion art pieces using code makes the workshop fun, interesting, and highly engaging.
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?

The Cinder framework is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems, ensuring that participants can participate in the workshop regardless of their preferred platform.
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?

Participants will have the opportunity to present and share their motion art creations with the group. They can demonstrate the unique aspects of their projects, explain their design choices, and discuss the challenges they overcame. This showcase session allows participants to gain recognition, inspire others, and foster a sense of ownership and pride in their creative achievements.
